# CONTEXT

This project is a fresh start for a Solana token monitoring bot. The service will
watch new token creations using the Helius websocket RPC (additional platforms to
be added later) and collect metadata from sources such as rugcheck.xyz,
dexscreener, and birdeye. Token data is stored in MongoDB and evaluated against
rules to identify "Gems". Notifications and updates are sent through a Telegram
bot.

Architecture includes configuration loading, database models, data source
integrations, assessment and monitoring services, performance tracking, and bot
commands. All modules currently contain placeholder functions that raise
`NotImplementedError` until they are implemented.
