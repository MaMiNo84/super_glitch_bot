# AGENTS

This repository hosts a skeleton for a Solana token monitoring service. The following guidelines apply when modifying the repository:

- Keep the architecture modular and maintainable.
- Use Python 3 with type hints and format code using `black` with line length 88.
- When functions are not implemented yet, they may raise `NotImplementedError`.
- After making changes, install requirements and attempt to run the main module:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python -m super_glitch_bot.main
  ```
  The main module currently fails with `NotImplementedError`, which is expected.
- Add tests under `super_glitch_bot/tests` when applicable.
- Document significant updates in the README.
